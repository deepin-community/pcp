sample.bin PMID: 29.0.6 [Several constant instances]
    Data Type: 32-bit int  InDom: 29.2 0x7400002
    Semantics: instant  Units: none
Help:
9 instances labelled "bin-100" thru "bin-900", each with an
initial value of 100 thru 900.

pmstore(1) may be used to change the values of some or all of
the instances, but note this will also change the values of the
metrics that share the same underlying values, i.e. sample.bucket,
sample.part_bin, sample.bogus_bin, sample.scramble.bin
sample.long.bin, sample.long.bin_ctr, sample.ulong.bin,
sample.ulong.bin_ctr, sample.longlong.bin, sample.longlong.bin_ctr,
sample.ulonglong.bin, sample.ulonglong.bin_ctr, sample.float.bin,
sample.float.bin_ctr, sample.double.bin, sample.double.bin_ctr
and sample.string.bin.

sample.seconds PMID: 29.0.2 [Elapsed time (seconds)]
    Data Type: 32-bit unsigned int  InDom: PM_INDOM_NULL 0xffffffff
    Semantics: counter  Units: sec
Help:
The elapsed time since the PMDA started, in seconds, i.e. as returned
by time(2).
