.TH PMCONFIG 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmconfig\f1 \- Performance Co-Pilot configuration parameters
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmconfig\f1
[\f3\-alLs?\f1]
[\f2name ...\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmconfig
displays the values for some or all configuration parameters
of the local Performance Co-Pilot toolkit installation.
.SH OPTIONS
The available command line options are:
.TP 5
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR
Reports all configuration parameters in the default format.
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR
Synonym for the
.B \-a
option, reports the same (default) format.
.TP
\fB\-L\fR, \fB\-\-library\fR
This option changes the default reporting mode so that the
capabilities of the PCP library are reported, rather than the
PCP environment.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-shell\fR
An output format suitable for sourcing in shell scripts
which ensures configuration information is quoted and
preceded by an export statement.
When not reporting the library capabilities, this mode will
produce a statement that does not override an existing setting
in the environment for PCP configuration variables.
.TP
\fB\-?\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display usage message and exit.
.PP
In the default operating mode,
.B pmconfig
is often used in conjunction with the
.B $PCP_DIR
environment variable to setup scripts running under the Windows
operating system, where the filesystem hierarchy differs greatly
to the of Linux/UNIX-based operating systems.
.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fI/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR pmGetConfig (3),
.BR pcp.conf (5)
and
.BR pcp.env (5).
